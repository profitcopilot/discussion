# I immediately started posting affiliate links in forums. Every opportunity I saw I used to get more sales.

I didn’t see the people, I just saw the dollar signs. I started sending private messages too. I did everything I could to get more traffic and try and make a sale.

Nothing good happened from that. I didn’t make any sales and of course I was banned rightly so. Even now those types of ebooks haven’t changed all that much.

Everyday I see newbies doing the exact same thing, but on social media.

What usually happens to them is that they get banned from Facebook groups or they get blocked and ignored. Eventually their account gets flagged and that gets banned too.

Those books never tell you that. So what’s going on here and why aren’t you getting the sales you deserve? Most importantly what can you do to fix it?

First, stop posting affiliate links everywhere. All you are doing is irritating people. I am not in any position to criticize anyone.

I respect your hustle, but I do want to make sure that your hustle leads you to success. If you are perceived as annoying then all you’re really doing is repelling and pushing away the people that you need to attract.

That is the exact opposite of what you need to do. When you attract people what happens then? People will want to hear what you have to say.

That is the first step in building trust.
